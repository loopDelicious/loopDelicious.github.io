### How your data appears in Keen IO

Within a few minutes, you should start to see data flowing into Keen IO provided your Monitor is running.  If you’ve sent the results of multiple Postman Monitors to Keen, you’ll be able to segment by monitor name/id, collection name/id, error code, etc. 

Here’s a preview of analyses from the Postman Monitors integration. You can build visualizations into dashboards that your team or customers can view, by utilizing [Keen dashboard templates](https://keen.io/docs/visualize/how-to-create-a-dashboard/){:target="_blank"}.
