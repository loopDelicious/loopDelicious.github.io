### Simulate a back end with Postman's mock servers

Throughout the development process, delays on the front end or back end can hold up dependent teams from completing their work efficiently.  

Using Postman's mock servers, front-end developers can simulate each endpoint in a Postman Collection (and corresponding environment) to view the potential responses, without actually spinning up a back end.

Front-end, back-end and API teams can now work in parallel, freeing up developers who were previously delayed as a result of these dependencies.

### Setting up the mock

Developers can mock a request and response in Postman before sending the actual request or setting up a single endpoint to return the response. Establishing an [example](/docs/postman/collections/examples) during the earliest phase of API development requires clear communication between team members, aligns their expectations, and means developers and testers can get started more quickly.

There are two ways to create a mock: 

  1. [using the Postman app](/docs/postman/mock_servers/mocking_with_examples)
  2. [using the Postman Pro API](/docs/postman/mock_servers/mock_with_api)

### Free mock server calls with your Postman account

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free mock server calls per month. You can check your usage limits through the [Postman Pro API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com) or the [account usage page](https://go.pstmn.io/postman-account-limits).
