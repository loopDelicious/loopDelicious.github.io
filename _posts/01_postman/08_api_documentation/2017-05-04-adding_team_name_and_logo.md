Postman users with the **Admin** member role can add a team name and logo to their Postman team account directly from the [Edit Team Details page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams/edit).

### Update your team name

You can see your current team name on the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) of the Postman web view.

If you didn’t enter a team name when you first created your Postman Pro or Enterprise team, you can update that now. From the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), click the gear icon in the top right, and select “Edit team” to update your team name.

### Update your team logo

From the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), click the gear icon in the top right, and select “Edit team” to add or update your team logo.

This uploaded image will be displayed in the header of your team's [published documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation) instead of the Postman logo. It may take up to 5 minutes for the logo to update.

### Custom team URLs

At Postman, we believe our product should have a clean and accessible URL design. Custom team URLs are available for Postman Pro and Enterprise users. This makes Postman features easier to access and streamlines the sign in process. 

Team URLs to access Postman are derived from your team name. With a custom team URL, you can access the Postman web view by typing `<your-team-name>.postman.co` into your browser. 

For example, if my team name is “postmanlabs”, my custom team URL will now be `postmanlabs.postman.co`, and all features will be predictably accessible by appending `/docs`, `/monitors`, or any other Postman features.
